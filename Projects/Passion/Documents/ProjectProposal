Name of the Project:Mobile App for Library
Type of the Project:Individual
The Basic Idea:My Project is making a mobile app for library that can access library through the portal of an institute.Every Student can use this app to take the books from library.It would be like a student registering for a particular book through this app where the admin gets the notification and after receiving the book from the admin the student gets a notification regarding the submission date will be reminded.Review would be taken from the student who completes reading the book.This app would be used not only in a particular institute but to all institutes.One can access other institute library by taking the permission of the library admin of that institute.An online chat can be done among the students regarding a specific book.
